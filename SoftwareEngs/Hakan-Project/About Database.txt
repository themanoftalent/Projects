Teacher, I couldn't create a normal database. That's why there is no sign in and sign up section.
I was able to save and view locally, but i wasn't delete the data. I had a problem with 
my Remove button. I tried to fix it but it didn't work, so I made the application work properly.
I wrote the codes that I ran in the local database but had to delete because they weren't efficient.

function saveData(){
    localStorage.setItem("data",TaskList.innerHTML)
}
function showTask(){
    TaskList.innerHTML = localStorage.getItem("data");
}
showTask();
function clearData() {
    localStorage.removeItem("data");
}
clearData();
